# Re.code Summer Intership Challenge

Choose one of the following challenges:

### Option A: Rails Extended ‚ö°Ô∏è
Build a fullstack web application using Rails 6.

We want you to demonstrate the ability to learn something new... something we didn't teach in the Bootcamp: This means no more simple CRUD applications.

You'll get points for creating something new and different - so take some risk and live a little. 

### Option B: The Frontend Guru üé®

Your client has given you this design specification and want you to build it out - pixel perfect. That means mastering your CSS magic - perfect padding, margin, alignment, colors, and typography.

And one more thing. You have to use one of the following Javascript frameworks:
- Vue https://vuejs.org/
- Angular https://angular.io
- React https://reactjs.org/

Hint: Vue will probably be the easiest to pick up.

We don't expect you to know these frameworks in and out, just enough to complete this application.

You will be graded on how closely your app resembles the specs, and the structure of your CSS. 

Data should be fetched from https://newsapi.org/

### Option C: Native Speaker üì±
Using the same design specs as Option B, build a native version of the application using the Flutter framework https://flutter.dev. 

Yes, that means that this app can (eventually) be downloaded onto your phone from the App Store, though you don't need to get to this part. 

You can take some liberty in how the app looks, it should just have the same functionality. 

Learning a new stack is hard enough - we don't expect it to look pixel perfect.

Note: Compiling your Flutter app for iOS will not be possible without a Mac, so build an Android version instead.

### Option D: Augmented Reality ¬†üöÄ
Learn a variant of Javascript called TypeScript and use it to go through the tutorials and learn how to create an augmented reality experience using the ZapWorks Studio system. 

Demonstrate your ability to use TypeScript by coding an AR experience using Zapworks Studio https://zap.works/studio/.

## Judging Criteria
Unless specified otherwise, your code will be judged based on the following:
- Good code structure
- DRY-ness
- Indentation (no more excuses)
- OOP (object-oriented) best practices
- Good variable naming
- Commnets and documentation

## Submission
We recommend spending about 5 hours on this challenge. It is due on Sunday September 15. Please push your solutions to github and send us an email with the title **Internship Challenge** to recode@recodemalaysia.com. Include which Option you picked and your github link in the email. Good luck everyone!
